## Testing Server Side Rendering and FramerMotion

This project was undertaken as an exercise to test the features of Next.js 14 and explore its server-side rendering capabilities.

The developed landing page is a simple yet effective representation of the integration of Next.js 14. In this application, an API call is made, and through the use of hooks and components that leverage server-side rendering, we incorporate dynamic animations provided by FrameMotion.

The choice to use server-side rendering is not only based on improving loading efficiency but also on the opportunity to optimize the user experience by ensuring a fast and seamless display of content.

In addition to the integration of animations, techniques have been implemented to further accelerate content loading, thus ensuring an optimal user experience. This project is not just a technical exercise but also a practical demonstration of how Next.js 14 can empower the creation of efficient and visually appealing web pages.
